A visual simulation environment for the geometric amoebot model of programmable matter, focusing on the model's *reconfigurable circuit* and *joint movement* extensions.
Developed at the [Theory of Distributed Systems](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/en/ti) group at Paderborn University.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://martmannupb.github.io/AmoebotSim-2.0/) for instructions on how to install and use the simulator.
A static version of the documentation is archived in [`Documents/docs.zip`](Documentation/docs.zip).

The project uses [Unity](https://unity.com/) version 6.
