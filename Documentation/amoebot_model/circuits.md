# Reconfigurable Circuits

![Here we see multiple circuits on an amoebot configuration.](../images/amoebotscreencircuits.jpg "Reconfigurable Circuits")

In the basic Amoebot model, information can only be transmitted between neighboring Amoebots.
This means that it may take $\Omega(n)$ rounds for a message to spread through a system of $n$ Amoebots.
The *reconfigurable circuits* extension allows the Amoebots to establish so-called *circuits*, which are structures spanning an arbitrary number of Amoebots allowing the instant transmission of signals to all Amoebots that are part of the circuit.
The significantly faster communication allows the Amoebots to tackle problems in new ways and decrease the number of rounds required to solve problems.


## Model Description

The following description is taken and edited from [*Coordinating Amoebots via Reconfigurable Circuits*][1] by Feldmann, Padalkin, Scheideler and Dolev (Springer International Publishing, 2021) and [*The Structural Power of Reconfigurable Circuits in the Amoebot Model*][2] by Padalkin, Scheideler and Warner (Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz-Zentrum f√ºr Informatik, 2022):

In our reconfigurable circuit extension, each edge between two neighboring amoebots $u$ and $v$ is replaced by $k$ edges called *external links* with endpoints called *pins*, for some constant $k \geq 1$ that is the same for all Amoebots.
For each of these links, one pin is owned by $u$ while the other pin is owned by $v$.
We assume that the $k$ pins on the side of $u$ resp. $v$ are consecutively numbered from $0$ to $k-1$, and there are two possible ways by which these pins are matched (i.e., belong to the same link).
If $u$ and $v$ have the same chirality, pin $i$ of $u$ is matched with pin $k - i - 1$ of $v$, and if $u$ and $v$ have different chiralities, pin $i$ of $u$ is matched with pin $i$ of $v$.

Each Amoebot $u$ partitions its pin set $P(u)$ into a collection $\mathcal{Q}(u)$ of pairwise disjoint subsets such that the union equals the pin set, i.e., $P(u) = \bigcup_{Q \in \mathcal{Q}(u)} Q$.
We call $\mathcal{Q}(u)$ the *pin configuration* of $u$ and $Q \in \mathcal{Q}(u)$ a *partition set* of $u$.
Let $\mathcal{Q} = \bigcup_{u \in S} \mathcal{Q}(u)$ be the collection of all partition sets in the system.
Two partition sets are *connected* iff there is at least one external link between those sets.
Let $L$ be the set of all connections between the partition sets in the system.
Then, we call $H = (\mathcal{Q}, L)$ the *pin configuration* of the system and any connected component $C$ of $H$ a *circuit*.
Note that if each partition set of $\mathcal{Q}$ is a *singleton*, i.e., a set with exactly one element, then every circuit of $H$ just connects two neighboring amoebots.
However, an external link between the neighboring amoebots $u$ and $v$ can only be maintained as long as both, $u$ and $v$ occupy the incident nodes.
Whenever two Amoebots disconnect, the corresponding external links and their pins are removed from the system.
An Amoebot is part of a circuit iff the circuit contains at least one of its partition sets.
A priori, an Amoebot $u$ may not know whether two of its partition sets belong to the same circuit or not since initially it only knows $\mathcal{Q}(u)$.

Each Amoebot $u$ can send a primitive signal (a *beep*) via any of its partition sets $Q \in \mathcal{Q}(u)$ that is received by all partition sets of the circuit containing $Q$ at the beginning of the next round.
The Amoebots are able to distinguish between beeps arriving at different partition sets.
More specifically, an Amoebot receives a beep at partition set $Q$ if at least one Amoebot sends a beep on the circuit belonging to $Q$, but the Amoebots neither know the origin of the signal nor the number of origins.
Note that beeps are enough to send whole messages over time, especially between adjacent Amoebots.
We modify an activation of an Amoebot as follows.
As a function of its previous state and the beeps received in the previous round, each Amoebot may perform a movement, update its state, reconfigure its pin configuration, and activate an arbitrary number of its partition sets.
The beeps are propagated on the updated pin configurations.
