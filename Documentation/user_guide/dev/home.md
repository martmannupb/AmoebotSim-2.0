# Algorithm Development

These pages explain the workflow for creating and developing custom amoebot algorithms.

The guide starts with a short tutorial on how new algorithms are created, followed by an overview of the components that constitute an algorithm file.
The rest of the guide shows a complete walkthrough of the development process for a simple demo algorithm and a selection of extensions demonstrating some of the more advanced features.
Some of the more complex topics that are encountered in this process are explained in their own reference pages, which are linked when they become relevant.

If you want to follow along, please make sure that the simulator project has been setup as described in the [Installation Guide](~/installation_guide/home.md).
