# API Documentation

These pages contain the inline code documentation that can be found in the C# source files.
Use them to browse through API methods, learn how the simulator is implemented, or as an alternative if your IDE does not display the code documentation automatically.

For algorithm developers, the most important classes are:
- [`ParticleAlgorithm`][1]: Contains all API methods available in Amoebot algorithms
- [`InitializationMethod`][2]: Contains all API methods available in system initialization/generation methods
- [`PinConfiguration`][3], [`PartitionSet`][4], [`Pin`][5] and [`Message`][6]: Contain the API for setting up pin configurations and sending and receiving beeps and messages
- [`ParticleAttribute`][7]: Base class for particle state attributes


> [!NOTE]
> This generated documentation contains only comments for `public` classes and methods.
> The source files may contain more information than what is visible here.
