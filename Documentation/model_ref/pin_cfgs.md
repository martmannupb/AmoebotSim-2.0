# Model Reference: Pin Configurations

- The **pin configuration** of a particle defines how the particle's pins are connected internally
	- Each algorithm specifies the **number of pins** $n$ used by the particles
	- This means that every particle will have $n$ pins on each of its incident edges
		- Contracted particles have $6n$ pins and expanded particles have $10n$ pins overall
	- The pins on each edge are numbered $0,\ldots,n-1$ in *local* counter-clockwise direction
	- Neighboring particles do not know the pin numberings of each other
	- The pins of two particles incident to the same edge are connected, allowing the particles to form circuits
		- If they have the same chirality, pin $0$ of one particle will be connected to pin $n-1$ of the other, pin $1$ to $n-2$, etc.
		- If they have different chirality, connected pins will have the same number
	- A particle can connect its pins internally by forming **partition sets**
		- A partition set is a set of interconnected pins
		- A pin that has no connections to other pins (of the same particle!) is a *singleton* partition set
	- The pin configuration of a particle is simply the set of its partition sets
		- A *singleton pin configuration* is a pin configuration in which all partition sets are singletons, i.e., there are no internal connections between the pins
		- In a *global pin configuration*, all pins are contained in the same partition set
	- Two partition sets of neighboring particles are connected if they contain a pair of pins on the same edge that are connected
	- A *circuit* is a maximal connected set of partition sets
		- A circuit can contain multiple different partition sets of the same particle
		- If a circuit contains at least one partition set of each particle, it is called a *global circuit*
