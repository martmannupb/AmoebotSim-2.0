# Dev Guide: User Interface

The User Interface has been created directly in the Unity editor. You see it in the hierarchy view where you can also find the MonoBehavior instances with the references to all the UI elements in the scene. The UI must be able to process inputs from the user, react to those display valid feedback at all times. Also the interactions between the systems have to be implemented in a way so that there cannot occur any exceptions that break the simulator. To avoid losing control over too many interwined systems, the UI has a modular structure. We have a system for the basic UI (UIHandler), the particle panel on the left (ParticleUIHandler), the init mode (InitializationUIHandler), the panel for the setting (SettingsUIHandler) and the log (LogUIHandler). The handlers themselves have many references to other parts of the simulator (mostly ParticleSystem and RenderSystem and the other handlers), since input needs to be processed and feedback from these systems is shown to the user. E.g. the WorldSpaceUIHandler registers every particle once the particle registers to the RendererParticles class over a call to the ParticleGraphicsAdapterImpl class, this reference is removed once the particle removes itself from the renderer. This way the WorldSpaceUIHandler can request data from the particle itself when it needs to draw or update the world space overlay used to show current particle attribute data.
